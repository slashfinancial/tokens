# Binance Smart Chain The Platform

\
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Economic whitepaper states that its mission is to be a leading force in building the Internet of Value and its infrastructure. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is working to create an alternative, scalable financial system which is more secure, transparent, efficient, inclusive, and equitable for everyone. As a result of all these, we selected BNB's blockchain.

to construct an efficient and secured consensus protocol, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) tackled the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains:

&#x20;• **Efficiency:** Existing blockchains as employed by major crypto-currencies (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) do not scale well to handle a large transaction volume; e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum (V1) can run around ten transactions/second. This small throughput severely hinders the widespread adoption of such cryptocurrencies.

• **Confirmation times:** The 10 minutes Bitcoin block-time is significantly larger than the network latency. Furthermore, a Bitcoin block requires five subsequent blocks following it to be confirmed; thus, it takes on average one hour for a transaction to be approved (with low confidence). While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many vital applications (especially smart contract applications).

&#x20;• **Fork Generation:** The problem of the fork chain consumes computational energy, time and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. (Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Technical Whitepaper V1.0)
