# Security

\
The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) core blockchain is operated and secured by the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)Masternode network. A Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus algorithm governs the core layer of the blockchain; This enables a fully decentralized, optimized, and cost-effective transactional system for developers to create innovative, scalable applications with minimal cost on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Masternodes are full nodes that play a crucial role in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem by creating, verifying, and validating newly-generated blocks.

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers developers and businesses the opportunity to encrypt transactions for private or sensitive data securely; This is achieved through Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Privacy, offering anonymous transactions through double validation security enhancements, randomization, and obfuscating transactional data, including wallet addresses and transaction values.
