# Security

  
The TomoChain core blockchain is operated and secured by the TomoChain Masternode network. A Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus algorithm governs the core layer of the blockchain; This enables a fully decentralized, optimized, and cost-effective transactional system for developers to create innovative, scalable applications with minimal cost on TomoChain. TomoChain Masternodes are full nodes that play a crucial role in the TomoChain ecosystem by creating, verifying, and validating newly-generated blocks.

TomoChain offers developers and businesses the opportunity to encrypt transactions for private or sensitive data securely; This is achieved through TomoChain Privacy, offering anonymous transactions through double validation security enhancements, randomization, and obfuscating transactional data, including wallet addresses and transaction values. \(What is TomoChain and the TOMO Coin, 2021\)
