# Transactions and Fee

  
SLSH currently needs TOMO cryptocurrency pair to pay transaction fees; for trade or buy SLSH Token, you'll need a bit of \(Near-Zero\) TOMO coin. As a milestone in our roadmap, we've planned to develop our network to allow traders to pay SLSH instead of TOMO for transaction fees; you'll be able to pay by SLSH itself; we're trying to create a seamless user experience.
