# Transactions and Fee

\
SLSH currently needs BNB cryptocurrency pair to pay transaction fees; for trade or buy SLSH Token, you'll need a bit of (Near-Zero) BNB coin. As a milestone in our roadmap, we've planned to develop our network to allow traders to pay SLSH instead of BNB for transaction fees; you'll be able to pay by SLSH itself; we're trying to create a seamless user experience.
