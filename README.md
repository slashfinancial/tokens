# Welcome to Slash Network

## Introduction

Slash Foundation Ltd. has launched a 150 Billion supply of SLSH tokens on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and provided a network by a protocol to decentralize a wide range of media and content production actors, both individuals and groups or companies.

Slash protocol categorizes these ranges on four branches, SMP, SCM, SSM, and SRA. SMP contains nodes that produce valuable content, whether music, video, text, photo, and all sorts of media; they can use SLSH token on our network to earn or spend it on their needs. SCM contains businesses, organizations, VOD's and other activists in the marketing and advertising field; they can gain from SMP's or spend for them and perform financial processes in a near-zero fee and fast blockchain. SSM is the network's merchants and sellers; they're physical or online merchants accepting SLSH and providing services in return. SRA are SMP's fans or network traders and holders; they can earn or stake SLSH and support this network of producers and value creators.\
