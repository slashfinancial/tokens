Slash protocol categorizes these ranges on four branches, SMP, SCM, SSM, and SRA. SMP contains whom that produce a valuable content weather music, video, text, photo and all sort of media; they can use SLSH token on our network to earn or spend it in their needs, SCM contains businesses, organizations, VOD's and other activists in marketing and advertising field, they can gain from SMP's or spend for them and perform financial processes in a near-zero fee and fast blockchain. SSM is the network's merchant and sellers; they're physical or online merchants that accept SLSH and provide services in return. SRA are SMP's fans or network traders and holders; they can earn or stake SLSH and support this network of producers and value creators.

It's necessary to stay in touch with us and follow our updates on social media and our announcement channels to up-to-date about our project and changes in paper and network.
