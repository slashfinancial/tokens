# SMP - Media and Production

\
We have considered many people in this category, including producers, gamers and game makers, podcasters, designers, influencers, bloggers and vloggers, writers, musicians, photographers, video creators, and more; note that they are not just individuals and can be companies or groups. In this branch, nodes can earn money and have financial relations in case of contracts with others.

In addition to the services that we've been providing for individuals, In our Roadmap, we plan to establish cooperation agreements with websites and organizations to connect to the decentralized Slash protocol and get extra benefits by providing services on our platform.
