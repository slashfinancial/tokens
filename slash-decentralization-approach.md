# Decentralization Approach

## Slash Decentralization Approach

In the world we live in, artists and content producers have limited places to present their work; they should successfully obey their terms and conditions to earn money in these places. According to these centralized and limited rules, we in Slash want to facilitate this matter. We won't limit income to space and time so that everyone in this area can quickly, without financial worries, focus on gaining its attention rather than try to make money.

### Key Idea and a Simple Example

Imagine that you're a new video producer on the YouTube platform, and you've been planning to become monetized and start to earn money; thus, you should catch up on some specific conditions. We believe that you need to reach those conditions to be a successful producer, but what should you do in this time gap to achieve those conditions? It would be best if you had something that doesn't need anything to earn money. Or if you've monetized before, you may have problem with taxation or sanctions that causes to you couldn't withdraw your money quickly and you might turn to third-party companies to help you to withdraw your money and have it for your needs, in that case also these companies will charge a significant fee to serve you.

Our world would be a better place for those people and organizations to use a decentralized and fast financial solution for their needs; fortunately, Slash is here for you; we have some answers to avoid those problems and have a network of nodes, these nodes are suitable for your career. You can easily interact with them with a singular language, blockchain! With our protocols, you can join through this network and with Slash tokens, quickly earn money and spend it for upgrading your studio gear, or advertise your channel, run your own business or campaigns, and so on.
